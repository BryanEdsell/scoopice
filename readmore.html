<h1 align="center"> History of ICE-CREAM </h1>

<p style="font-size:20px;text-align:center;line-height:30px;margin-bottom:20px"><font face="Stencil" color="cyen" background color="red"> Ice cream is a frozen dessert typically made from milk or cream that has been flavoured with <br>
a sweetener, either sugar or an alternative, and a spice, such as cocoa or vanilla,<br>
 or with fruit, such as strawberries or peaches. Food colouring is sometimes added <br>
 in addition to stabilizers. The mixture is cooled below the freezing point of water and<br>
 stirred to incorporate air spaces and prevent detectable ice crystals from forming. <br>
It can also be made by whisking a flavoured cream base and liquid nitrogen together.<br>
 The result is a smooth, semi-solid foam that is solid at very low temperatures<br>
 (below 2 °C or 35 °F). It becomes more malleable as its temperature increases.</font></p>
